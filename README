Averaged CESM1.2.2 output from runs used in McGraw et al dust nucleation paper

===============================================================================

Contains 5-year temporal averages of all single-level output variables from
CESM1.2.2 simulations with modified ice nucleation and MERRA nudged UV-winds

For larger variables involving multiple vertical levels, contact the authors.

Note: Files contain both standard CESM variables and custom variables. The
      quality of the custom variables is not guaranteed and their use may not
      be straightforward - contact the authors for more info.


Names match those used in Table S1 of the paper's supplement.

Also included are the prescribed surface dust emission files used to produce
these runs, for the four species that must be prescribed ('dst_a1','dst_a3',
'num_a1','num_a3') to represent mass and number of emitted dust in fine and
coarse modes.

Dust direct radiative impacts setting ('ddre'):
on
off

Cirrus dust nucleation setting:
bnu = Barahona & Nenes 2009 scheme with Ullrich et al 2017 depositional nucleation
bnd = B&N2009 scheme with David et al 2019 pore condensation & freezing nucleation

Accomodation coefficient:
1.0
0.1

Updraft settings ('ws')
warm cloud medium updraft
warm cloud weak updraft
warm cloud strong updraft
mixed-phase cloud temperature regime medium updraft
mixed-phase cloud temperature regime weak updraft
mixed-phase cloud temperature regime strong updraft
cirrus medium updraft
cirrus weak updraft
cirrus strong updraft

Mixed-phase cloud regime dust nucleation setting:
Ullrich et al 2017
DeMott et al 2015
Meyers et al 1992 (not aerosol sensitive)

other settings:
cirrus nucleation on dust off

low dust refractive index

modifications shared among runs:
detrainment modified as in Tan et al 2016
dust optical properties modified to those in Albani et al 2014
removed constraints on low/high ice crystal numbers in MG08 microphysics
WBF process efficiency weakened to 1% of default strength
UV winds nudged to MERRA reanalysis from 2004-2008
